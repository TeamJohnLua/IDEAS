# IDEAS

## THEME: DEEP SPACE

- Spesscow survival/simulation game
- Spesscow farm
- Something SS13-esque. Probably using spacebuild assets. Obviously much, much simpler because time constraints.
- Something similar to Elite Dankerous/Solarpower
- Something where you cooperatively control a spaceship. Could also use spacebuild assets? Something like this, but actually inside the ship? http://www.artemis.eochu.com/
- RTS? An RTS would be cool, but doing it in space could be a PITA.
